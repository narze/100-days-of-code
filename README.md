My take on #100DaysOfCode

## Day 1 (June 1, 2020)

Dev.to style profile header

Thoughts : 
Most ideas are from developer console & a browser extension to inspect CSS values, hope I'll get better & faster soon (Can't even remember how to center things!) takes 1:30 hr.

Thoughts : 
Side project for my sis-in-law which she opens a local restaurant then have her customers asked for food order via Facebook messenger. Their first question is `Can I see the food menu?`

Things I learned :
- Vue.js (First time)
- Tailwind.css (First time too)
- Netlify (Connect Github then the web is deployed automatically every git pushes)
