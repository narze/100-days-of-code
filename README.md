# 100-days-of-code

My take on #100DaysOfCode

## Day 1 (June 1, 2020)

Dev.to style profile header

Thoughts :
Most ideas are from developer console & a browser extension to inspect CSS values, hope I'll get better & faster soon (Can't even remember how to center things!) takes 1:30 hr.

## Day 2 (June 2, 2020)

Thoughts :
Side project for my sis-in-law which she opens a local restaurant then have her customers asked for food order via Facebook messenger. Their first question is `Can I see the food menu?`

Things I learned :
- Vue.js (First time)
- Tailwind.css (First time too)
- Netlify (Connect Github then the web is deployed automatically every git pushes)

## Day 3 (June 3, 2020)

BSP.js (Binary Space Partitioning)

Thoughts :
I am making BSP layout for [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix). Its configuration is in Javascript so I can move the code once it's ready. This project will be a long one I think.

Things I learned :
- Creating DOM and move around with Javascript
- `box-sizing: border-box;`

Thoughts :
The first day I'm back at office so I don't have much time as the first 3 days. This idea pops up while I'm on the way to work! (I hate pointless meetings.)

Things I learned :
- [Vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/), and how confusing Webpack is.
- Test Driven Development with Mocha & Chai.
- Deployment via Netlify with simple settings https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#netlify.

## Day 5 (June 5, 2020)

#100DaysOfCode CSS Ribbon

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oDkiZWY.png)

Thoughts :
I try to remind myself that I want to improve CSS skills more than calculating things like before, so here it is, pure CSS!

Things I learned :
- CSS class cannot lead with numbers (eg. `.100-days-of-code` is not valid), like variables
- Using HTML attributes as content by using `attr()`
