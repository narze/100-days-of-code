# 100-days-of-code

My take on #100DaysOfCode

## Day 1 (June 1, 2020)

Dev.to style profile header

Thoughts :
Most ideas are from developer console & a browser extension to inspect CSS values, hope I'll get better & faster soon (Can't even remember how to center things!) takes 1:30 hr.

## Day 2 (June 2, 2020)

CoreMenu webapp (Thai)

Thoughts :
Side project for my sis-in-law which she opens a local restaurant then have her customers asked for food order via Facebook messenger. Their first question is `Can I see the food menu?`

Things I learned :
- Vue.js (First time)
- Tailwind.css (First time too)
- Netlify (Connect Github then the web is deployed automatically every git pushes)

## Day 3 (June 3, 2020)

BSP.js (Binary Space Partitioning)

Thoughts :
I am making BSP layout for [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix). Its configuration is in Javascript so I can move the code once it's ready. This project will be a long one I think.

Things I learned :
- Creating DOM and move around with Javascript
- `box-sizing: border-box;`

## Day 4 (June 4, 2020)

MeasureMeet : Measure your meeting time in man-minutes

Thoughts :
The first day I'm back at office so I don't have much time as the first 3 days. This idea pops up while I'm on the way to work! (I hate pointless meetings.)

Things I learned :
- [Vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/), and how confusing Webpack is.
- Test Driven Development with Mocha & Chai.
- Deployment via Netlify with simple settings https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/deployment.html#netlify.

## Day 5 (June 5, 2020)

#100DaysOfCode CSS Ribbon

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oDkiZWY.png)

Thoughts :
I try to remind myself that I want to improve CSS skills more than calculating things like before, so here it is, pure CSS!

Things I learned :
- CSS class cannot lead with numbers (eg. `.100-days-of-code` is not valid), like variables
- Using HTML attributes as content by using `attr()`

## Day 6 (June 6, 2020)

Put Day 5 project (CSS Ribbon) into npm

Thoughts :
To make it easier to include the ribbon in my next days I published into npm in order to use it via CDNs like unpkg or jsdelivr.

Link : https://github.com/narze/100-days-of-code-ribbon

Things I learned :
- Publishing `100-days-of-code-ribbon` to npm is not allowed and is tagged as spam.
- I accidentally published & unpublished `hundred-days-of-code-ribbon` and the package name is blocked for 24 hours, so I have to rename it to `hundred-days-of-code-css-ribbon`.
- Just updating the readme file needs to bump the package's version :(

Link : https://www.npmjs.com/package/hundred-days-of-code-css-ribbon

## Day 7 (June 8, 2020)

"Yesion" : A clone of Notion homepage

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/aKdqQAR.jpg)

Thoughts :
Creating navbar without CSS framework or flexbox is really hard for me, especially with logo image & both left and right floats.

Things I learned :

- Floating divs
- Centering divs vertically

## Day 8 (June 9, 2020)

Yesion (Cont.) : Add CSS dropdown menu

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Aajsz7l.png)

Thoughts : 
Embedding div within anchor within div to get the highlight effect I want.

Things I learned :

- Setting CSS rules without `>` sometimes causes unexpected results, maybe that's why having classes are better.

## Day 9 (June 10, 2020)

Try Svelte (https://svelte.dev/)

Thoughts :
Learn throught Scrimba, both the framework & the web are great.
