My take on #100DaysOfCode

## Day 1 (June 1, 2020)

Dev.to style profile header

Thoughts : 
Most ideas are from developer console & a browser extension to inspect CSS values, hope I'll get better & faster soon (Can't even remember how to center things!) takes 1:30 hr.

Thoughts : 
Side project for my sis-in-law which she opens a local restaurant then have her customers asked for food order via Facebook messenger. Their first question is `Can I see the food menu?`

Things I learned :
- Vue.js (First time)
- Tailwind.css (First time too)
- Netlify (Connect Github then the web is deployed automatically every git pushes)

## Day 3 (June 2, 2020)

BSP.js (Binary Space Partitioning)

Thoughts: 
I am making BSP layout for [Phoenix](https://github.com/kasper/phoenix). Its configuration is in Javascript so I can move the code once it's ready. This project will be a long one I think.

Things I learned :
- Creating DOM and move around with Javascript
- `box-sizing: border-box;`
